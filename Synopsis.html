    <p>In the year 2200: humanity has successfully created a way for memories to be revisited. Relived. </p>

    <p> People find themselves going “back in time.” Many of whom do so to escape reality.
        To escape pain, and in the process become addicted to the memories of what they believe were better days.</p>

    <p> It’s not long before skilled tinkerers find a way to alter memories,
        a highly illegal practice deemed so by the
        powers that be. </p>

    <p> For those bold enough to enter this dangerous state of memory alteration, few ever make it out. </p>
    <p> Then again, who would want to? </p>

    Death by <b> nostalgia </b> is the best kind of death.
