    <h1>Night Owl</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A young woman moves to a small town on behalf of a new job.</p>

    <p> With the potential for better things, she views the move as an opportunity for growth.</p>

    <p> As the months go by and her life continues to get better, odd things begin to happen at home.
        While sleeping in her bedroom one evening she is woken up by a small, unnatural light Perplexed, she watches in
        awe.</p>

    <p> As the light approaches her she cautiously reaches out to touch it only for it to burn her. She pulls her hand
        back and in doing so triggers the light to shine brighter.</p>

    <p> As she leaps from her bed to escape via her bedroom door, more small lights appear and her closet door begins to
        shake as a bright light shines from behind it.</p>

    <p> When she finally reaches her bedroom door the small lights latch on to her, causing 3rd degree burns.
        She escapes the bedroom with severe burns and passes out from the pain. She awakes the next morning completely
        fine as if nothing happened. </p>

    <!-- So I was thinking, for Night Owl the creature known as "The Anomaly" has others like it or rather siblings. Each
        has
        strength based compatible the number of eyes it has, and a title given to them for their abilities -->
