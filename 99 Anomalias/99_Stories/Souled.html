    <h1>Souled</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The devil always collects his due, as is customary when mortals, foolish or otherwise, make a deal with him

        Yet as time has passed and humans continue to “go forth and multiply “ the prince of darkness has become quite
        busy and technological advancements, along with other worldly sources, have kept humans living longer than he’d like them
        to.

        What’s Lucifer to do?

        Outsource.

        And who better to acquire his loot than his “liaisons?”

        Or collectors as they’re also labeled, are the children, grandchildren, and descendants of those that attempted
        to sell their souls before they were born, but even Mammon can be fair and gives the offspring the choice of living
        luxurious lives and giving up their souls when they die or for them to be his liaisons when they come of age.

        The days mortals reaching for immortality are over.

        Debts will be paid, and hell hath no fury like a prince of darkness scorned
