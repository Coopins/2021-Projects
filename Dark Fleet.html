        <p> mans brother goes missing under unknown
            circumstances.</p>

        <p>While searching through his things at his
            brothers apartment, he finds recordings of
            his brother describing his most recent job
            and the odd situations he found himself in.</p>

        The brother, a truck driver by trade, was
        down on his luck after being responsible for
        the deaths of a couple while driving.

        Falling further into financial ruin and
        alcoholism it appeared that things began to
        look up as he was offered the chance to drive
        again but not under normal terms.

        The “company” had no name, the trucks and
        trailers were black, driving was only to be
        done at night, there was no stopping under
        any circumstances, doors were to remain
        locked and windows were to be up at all
        times, no music was to be played and if
        anything was heard, such as talking, no
        response was to be given. Drivers would only
        be contacted when checkpoints are reached
        as well as the destinations. When
        destinations were reached, drivers were told
        to cover their faces with a hood so nothing
        could be seen.

        The job paid very well and as time went on
        the bother not only got himself back on his
        feet but was also supportive of others.

        He was a good man. But even good people
        go missing.

        After reaching his destination and docking
        the truck, he failed to cover his face.
        Curiosity got the better of him as he looked
        into the drivers side mirror. There was little
        light but he thought he saw two people
        talking. As he stared more into the mirror as
        to get a better look, he saw what he thought
        was a face. The “person” slowly turned their
        head, staring into his mirror. Staring into him.

        The person seemed to have only one eye. It
        was a deep red. It glowed. There was nothing
        else. For what seemed liked forever staring at
        this “person” he snapped back to his senses
        and put the hood over his head.

        Though shaken, he went on like nothing
        happened yet he couldn’t shake this
        unnerving feeling. What was it that he had
        seen? The job was strange in itself and
        maybe what he had done wasn’t a big deal.
        But maybe it was. There were rules in place
        for a reason.

        Several sleepless nights occurred, then
        isolation, and then…nothing.

        He was gone.

        On the last recording, there’s mention of
        going “home” several times.

        The brother, disturbed by all that he had
        heard, grabbed what he could and left the
        apartment. It was dark and the night seemed
        eerie. “It had to be from what he had heard”
        he reasoned.

        He rushed to his car, started it, and sped
        away from the apartments as if he needed to
        get away. To escape.

        It would take some time until he got home
        and the entire way he hoped to catch every
        green light he could. He didn’t feel safe. He
        knew the fear he felt was irrational, but his
        mind didn’t seem to think so.

        One light left. Yellow. Now red. He breaks out
        in a sweat. He was so close to home. Why
        this? Why now? The uneasy feeling gets
        worse. This time it’s justified.

        He looks around and sees only the traffic
        light, woods, and a deep red glowing light
        seemingly peering from them.

        He looks closer, just like his brother did that
        fateful night, doing his best to get a better
        look and immediately remembers the
        recordings. The “person” his brother saw. He
        speeds off in a panic, ignoring the traffic
        light.

        The “person” withdrew back into the woods.

        Like his brother, he wouldn’t be getting any
        sleep tonight.

        Or anytime soon...
