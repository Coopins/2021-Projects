    <h1>Yuba County Five</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The Yuba County Five were all young men from Yuba City, California, United States, all with mild intellectual
        disabilities or psychiatric conditions, who attended a college basketball game at California State University,
        Chico on
        the night of February 24, 1978. Four of them—Bill Sterling, 29; Jack Huett, 24; Ted Weiher, 32; and Jack
        Madruga,
        30—were later found dead; the fifth, Gary Mathias, 25, has never been found.
    </p>

    <p>
        Several days after their initial disappearance, the group's Mercury Montego was found, abandoned, in a remote
        area of
        Plumas National Forest on a high mountain dirt road that was far out of their way back to Yuba City. However,
        investigators could not determine why the car was abandoned, as it was in good working order and could easily
        have been
        pushed out of the snowpack it was in. At that time, no trace of the men was found.

        After the snow melted in June 1978, four of the men's bodies were found in and near a trailer camp used by
        backpackers
        as shelter deep in the forest, 20 miles (32 km) from the car.[2] Only bones were left of the three bodies in the
        woods,
        a result of scavenging animals; but the one in the trailer, Ted Weiher, had apparently lived for as long as
        three months
        after the men were last seen, starving to death despite an ample supply of food and heating materials nearby.
        Weiher was
        missing his shoes, and investigators found Mathias' own shoes in the nearby woods, suggesting Mathias also
        survived for
        some time beyond the last night they were seen alive.

        A witness later came forward, a local man who said he had spent the same night in his own car a short distance
        away from
        where the Montego was found after suffering a mild heart attack trying to push it out of the snow. This witness
        told
        police that he had seen and heard people around the car that night, and twice called for help, only for them to
        grow
        silent and turn off their flashlights. This, and the considerable distance from the car to where the bodies were
        found,
        has led to suspicions of foul play.

        Background
    </h2>

    <hr>

    <p>
        While he was stationed in West Germany as part of his United States Army service in the early 1970s, Gary
        Mathias, a
        native of Yuba City, California, had developed drug problems. These eventually led to him being diagnosed with
        schizophrenia and being psychiatrically discharged. Mathias returned to his parents' home in Yuba City and began
        treatment at a local mental hospital. While it had been difficult at first—he was nearly arrested for assault
        twice and
        often suffered psychotic episodes that landed him in a local Veterans Administration hospital—by 1978 Mathias
        was being
        treated on an outpatient basis with Stelazine and Cogentin and was considered by his physicians to be "one of
        our
        sterling success cases."
    </p>

    <p>
        Mathias supplemented his Army disability pay by working in his stepfather's gardening business. Off the job,
        outside of
        his family, he was close friends with four other men, most slightly older than him, who either had slight
        intellectual
        disabilities (Sterling and Huett) or were informally considered "slow learners" (Weiher and Madruga, also an
        Army
        veteran) and who lived either in Yuba City or nearby Marysville. Like Mathias, each man lived with his parents,
        all of
        whom referred to them collectively as "the boys."
    </p>

    <p>
        The five men's favorite leisure activity was sports. Their families said that when they got together, it was
        usually to
        play a game or to watch one. They played basketball together as the Gateway Gators, a team sponsored by a local
        program
        for the mentally handicapped.
    </p>

    <p>
        On February 25, the Gators were due to play their first game in a weeklong tournament sponsored by the Special
        Olympics
        for which the winners would get a free week in Los Angeles. The five men had prepared the night before, some
        even laying
        out their uniforms and asking parents to wake them up on time. They decided to drive to Chico that night to
        cheer on the
        UC Davis basketball team in an away game against Chico State.

        Madruga, the only member of the group besides Mathias who had a driver's license, drove the group 50 miles (80
        km) north
        to Chico in his turquoise and white 1969 Mercury Montego. The men wore only light coats against the cool
        temperatures in
        the upper Sacramento Valley at night that time of year.
