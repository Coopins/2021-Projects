            Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for visiting my page.
            The internet is VAST! Yet you're here taking time out of your day to not only visit my page, but to maybe
            learn
            a bit about who I am (I'm not flattering myself, I swear...okay maybe I am just a little bit)
        </p>

        <p>As you can probably tell from my makeshift code, I'm an aspiring web developer.</p>
